**Selling Advice for You:**

1.  **Aim for Higher Returns:** If possible and economically viable, consider transporting your produce to markets like **KHAMMAM (Telangana Zone)**, where prices are currently offering the best returns (₹765). Always factor in your transportation costs to ensure the higher price still results in better net earnings.

2.  **Avoid Low-Priced Markets:** We advise caution if you are considering selling in markets like **ROHTAK (North Zone)**, where prices are significantly lower (₹515). Unless absolutely necessary, exploring alternative markets could yield better profits.

3.  **Check Local Conditions:** Prices can vary based on local supply, demand, and quality of produce. While this report gives you a broad overview, always try to verify the latest prices at your nearest preferred mandi before making a final decision.

4.  **Stay Updated:** Market conditions can change rapidly. Keep an eye on daily updates to ensure you are always selling at the best possible price.
